BAC SIMULATOR - SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
Detailed Explanation of Calculations and Methodology
================================================================================

1. WIDMARK EQUATION
================================================================================
The modified Widmark equation is the standard used in forensic toxicology:

    BAC = [(A × 5.14) / (W × r)] - (0.015 × H)

Where:
    A = Total alcohol consumed (in liquid ounces)
    W = Body weight (in pounds)
    r = Widmark distribution ratio (gender-specific)
    0.015 = Standard elimination rate (% BAC per hour)
    H = Hours since first drink

Constants:
    5.14 = Conversion factor from liquid ounces to blood alcohol percentage
    Male distribution ratio (r): 0.73
    Female distribution ratio (r): 0.66

Historical Note: This equation was developed by E.M.P. Widmark in 1932 and has
been extensively validated in forensic and clinical research.

2. DISTRIBUTION RATIOS
================================================================================
The distribution ratio (r) accounts for the difference in alcohol distribution
between men and women:

    Males:   r = 0.73 (higher water content in body, wider distribution)
    Females: r = 0.66 (lower water content, narrower distribution)

This difference is due to:
    - Different body composition (% body fat vs. lean muscle)
    - Alcohol distributes in water, not fat
    - Women typically have higher body fat % than men of same weight
    - Result: Women reach higher BAC with same amount of alcohol

Research basis:

    - Ramchandani, V.A., et al. (2001). Gender differences in pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics of alcohol. Alcohol & Alcoholism

3. ELIMINATION RATE
================================================================================
Alcohol elimination rate: 0.015% BAC per hour (approximately)

This equals:
    - 15 mg/100mL per hour (standard forensic unit)
    - 1 standard drink per 2-3 hours (depending on body weight)

Key Facts:
    - Elimination is relatively constant (zero-order kinetics)
    - NOT accelerated by exercise, coffee, cold showers, or sleep
    - Only TIME eliminates alcohol from the body
    - ~95% eliminated by the liver, ~5% by breath/sweat/urine

Individual Variation:
    - Normal range: 0.012-0.020% per hour
    - Chronic drinkers: Slightly faster (up to 20% faster, ~0.018%)
    - Genetic variation: Some populations metabolize slower
    - Medications can affect elimination rate

4. FOOD ABSORPTION MODEL
================================================================================
Food significantly affects BAC by delaying alcohol absorption. The simulator
models this using gastric emptying data.

GASTRIC EMPTYING HALF-TIMES (T1/2) BY FOOD TYPE:
    Empty stomach:      0 minutes        (immediate absorption)
    Water/clear liquid: 15 minutes
    Light snack:        60 minutes       (crackers, toast, chips)
    Light meal:         90 minutes       (soup, salad, light sandwich)
    Moderate meal:      120 minutes      (standard meal)
    Full meal:          150 minutes      (large meal)
    High-fat meal:      180 minutes      (burger, pizza, fried food)

PEAK BAC REDUCTION BY FOOD:
    Empty stomach:      0% reduction
    Water:              5% reduction
    Light snack:        20% reduction
    Light meal:         30% reduction
    Moderate meal:      40% reduction
    Full meal:          45% reduction
    High-fat meal:      60% reduction

Explanation of Food Effects:

1. When stomach is full, alcohol is absorbed more slowly
2. Fat slows gastric emptying more than protein or carbs
3. More food = longer delay = lower peak BAC
4. BUT: Total amount absorbed is the same eventually
5. Only TIMING and PEAK are affected, not total absorption

Absorption Model Used:
    - Exponential absorption based on stomach content
    - Stomach empties following exponential decay: C = C₀ × 2^(-t/T1/2)
    - Once stomach is mostly empty, absorption accelerates
    - Peak BAC typically occurs 30-90 minutes after absorption complete

      of alcohol

      alcohol
    - Jones, A.W. (2010). Aspects of in-vivo alcohol pharmacokinetics

5. METABOLIC VARIATIONS
================================================================================

AGE EFFECTS:
    - Young adults (18-25): Slightly faster metabolism (~5% faster)
    - Middle age (25-65): Standard rate
    - Elderly (65+): Slower metabolism (~10-15% slower)
    - Very elderly (75+): Significantly slower (~20-25% slower)

CHRONIC DRINKING STATUS:
    - Regular drinkers: ~15-25% faster metabolism
    - Mechanism: Induced cytochrome P450 enzyme activity
    - Develops over months of regular consumption
    - Does NOT prevent intoxication, only affects elimination rate

BODY COMPOSITION:
    - Alcohol distributes in water, not fat
    - Lean individuals: More water = wider distribution = lower peak BAC
    - Overweight individuals: Less water = narrower distribution = higher peak BAC
    - Simulator approximates using weight and gender (simplified model)

MEDICATIONS AFFECTING ALCOHOL METABOLISM:
    - Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, etc.): May increase absorption
    - Cimetidine (Tagamet): Inhibits alcohol metabolism, increases BAC
    - Aspirin: May increase gastric absorption
    - Fructose/glucose: May speed absorption
    - Simvastatin: May increase BAC

GENETIC VARIATION:
    - Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) deficiency: ~50% of East Asians
      - Slower acetaldehyde metabolism
      - Results in flushing, nausea, headache
      - Does NOT prevent intoxication
    - Other CYP450 variations: Different metabolic rates
    - Not included in simulator (insufficient individual data)

7. TENNESSEE DUI LAW (2024)
================================================================================
HB 1414 / SB 1117 - Enhance DUI threshold as of July 1, 2024:

    Standard DUI: BAC 0.08% or higher
    - Penalty: Up to 1 year jail, $350-$1,500 fine

    Enhanced DUI: BAC 0.15% or higher
    - Penalty: Minimum 7 days jail (mandatory), $600-$3,500 fine
    - Additional penalties: License suspension, ignition interlock

    Aggravated DUI: BAC 0.20% or higher (if minor in vehicle)
    - Enhanced penalties apply

The simulator displays this threshold prominently when BAC reaches 0.15%.

8. CALCULATION PROCESS IN SIMULATOR
================================================================================
STEP 1: Establish baseline profile
    - User weight, sex, age
    - Calculate Widmark distribution ratio based on sex
    - Account for chronic drinking status if applicable

STEP 2: Process food timeline
    - Identify most recent food before each drink
    - Determine gastric emptying time
    - Calculate absorption delay for each drink

STEP 3: For each time point in timeline:
    A) Calculate absorption for each drink
       - Determine how much of each drink has been absorbed
       - Account for food delays and gastric emptying
       - Apply peak BAC reduction based on food type

    B) Sum total alcohol absorbed from all drinks

    C) Apply Widmark equation
       BAC = [(Total Alcohol × 5.14) / (Weight × r)]

    D) Subtract elimination
       BAC_final = BAC_from_alcohol - (0.015 × hours_elapsed)

    E) Floor at zero (can't have negative BAC)
       BAC_final = max(0, BAC_final)

STEP 4: Generate timeline
    - Calculate BAC every 5 minutes for next 6-12 hours
    - Track peak BAC and time
    - Project time until legal limit (0.08%)
    - Project time until sobriety (0.00%)

9. LIMITATIONS & DISCLAIMERS
