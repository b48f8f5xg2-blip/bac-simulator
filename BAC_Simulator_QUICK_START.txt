BAC SIMULATOR - QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

WHAT IS THIS?
A desktop app that calculates your Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) based on what
you've eaten and drunk. It shows you real-time impairment levels and whether
you're legally safe to drive.

QUICK START (5 MINUTES):
================================================================================

1. OPEN THE APP
   - Double-click BAC_Simulator.app on your Desktop
   - Wait for the window to open (first time may take a few seconds)

2. ANSWER THE CHATBOT QUESTIONS (in order):
   ❓ "What's your biological sex?"
      → Type: male   or   female

   ❓ "What's your weight?"
      → Type: 180 lbs   or   82 kg

   ❓ "What's your height?"
      → Type: 6 feet   or   5'10"   or   70 inches

   ❓ "How old are you?"
      → Type: 30   or just   30

   ❓ "Do you drink regularly?"
      → Type: yes, most days   or   no, rarely

   ❓ "When did you start drinking?"
      → Type: 7pm   or   2 hours ago   or   now

3. TELL THE BOT ABOUT YOUR DRINKS & FOOD
   Examples you can say:
   - "I had 2 beers at 7pm"
   - "I drank a shot of vodka"
   - "I ate pizza at 6pm"
   - "Just had another beer"
   - "I had a mixed drink (cocktail) 40% alcohol"

4. WATCH YOUR BAC DISPLAY
   The big number on the right is your current BAC%

   Color meanings:
   🟢 GREEN = Sober / Safe to drive
   🟡 YELLOW = Mild impairment / Legal to drive but impaired
   🟠 ORANGE = Moderate impairment / DUI ILLEGAL
   🔴 RED = Severe impairment / DANGEROUS

5. CHECK THE TIMELINE
   The graph shows your BAC over the next 6 hours:
   - When it peaks
   - When you hit the legal limit (0.08%)
   - When you'll be sober again

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
================================================================================
Let's say you input:

Bot: "What's your weight?"
You: "180 pounds"

Bot: "What's your height?"
You: "6 feet"

Bot: "When did you start drinking?"
You: "7pm"

Bot: "Tell me about your drinks and food"
You: "I ate a big pizza at 6pm, then had 2 beers at 7pm and another at 8pm"

RESULT SHOWN:
- Current BAC: 0.0847% 🔴 ORANGE
- Status: Moderate impairment / DUI ILLEGAL
- Timeline: Will be sober in 4.5 hours
- Peak BAC was 0.0956% at 8:15pm
- You hit the legal limit (0.08%) about 15 minutes ago

KEY TIPS:
================================================================================

1. FOOD MATTERS A LOT
   - Empty stomach = BAC peaks FAST (30-60 min)
   - Full meal = BAC peaks SLOWER (90+ min)
   - Pizza/fatty food = Biggest delay (can reduce peak by 50-75%)
   - This is real science: food delays stomach emptying

2. NATURAL LANGUAGE WORKS
   The bot understands casual language:
   ✓ "I had a beer"
   ✓ "Drank whiskey"
   ✓ "Just ate pizza"
   ✓ "Mixed drink, 40% vodka"
   ✓ "Light beer, 12 ounces"
   ✓ "Started drinking 2 hours ago"

3. YOU CAN UPDATE IN REAL-TIME
   Just tell the bot:
   - "I just had another beer"
   - "Actually I ate lunch at noon"
   - "My weight is actually 190"
   The BAC will recalculate immediately

4. DRINK TYPES RECOGNIZED
   Beer: light beer, IPA, stout
   Wine: red wine, white wine
   Spirits: whiskey, vodka, rum, gin, tequila
   Mixed: cocktail, margarita, cosmopolitan

5. TIME FORMATS UNDERSTOOD
   - "7pm" or "7:30pm" (24-hour: "19:30")
   - "2 hours ago"
   - "30 minutes ago"
   - "now" or "just now"

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN:
================================================================================

BAC %          WHAT IT MEANS                  CAN I DRIVE?
==========================================================================
0.00%          Sober                          ✓ Yes (safe)
0.02-0.05%     Slight impairment              ✓ Yes (legal)
0.05-0.08%     Mild impairment                ✓ Yes (legal but not ideal)
0.08%          DUI threshold                  ✗ NO (illegal - DUI)
0.15%          Enhanced DUI (Tennessee)       ✗ NO (illegal - worse penalty)
0.20%          Severe impairment              ✗ NO (medical risk)
0.30%+         Dangerous/poisoning risk       ✗ NO (medical emergency)

LEGAL STATUS IN TENNESSEE:
    0.08% = DUI (1 year jail max, $350-$1,500 fine)
    0.15% = Enhanced DUI (7+ days mandatory jail, $600-$3,500 fine) ← 2024

IMPORTANT WARNINGS:
================================================================================

⚠️  THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL TOO L ONLY

DO NOT USE TO:
- Decide whether to drive
- Defend against DUI charges
- Make any legal decision
- Replace a breathalyzer or blood test

USE FOR:
- Understanding how alcohol metabolism works
- Learning how food affects BAC
- General education about impairment
- Seeing how long alcohol takes to leave your system

ACTUAL BAC VARIES:
- This tool is ±0.02% accurate typically
- Some people vary by ±0.04% or more
- Medications, genetics, and other factors affect real BAC
- Only a breathalyzer or blood test can measure actual BAC

WHEN IN DOUBT: DO NOT DRIVE
Call a taxi, Uber, Lyft, or use a designated driver
No one should ever get behind the wheel if unsure

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

App won't open?
→ Try double-clicking again or right-click "Open"

Can't type in the box?
→ Click the text field at the bottom first

Numbers look wrong?
→ Resize the window to be larger

Bot isn't recognizing my drink?
→ Try saying "beer", "wine", "whiskey", "cocktail", or "shot"

Still have questions?
→ See BAC_Simulator_README.txt for more details
→ See BAC_Simulator_SCIENTIFIC_BASIS.txt for the science

HAVE FUN LEARNING!
================================================================================
This app teaches you how your body processes alcohol. Use it to understand
the science behind alcohol metabolism and make better decisions about drinking
and driving.

Remember: The safest choice when in doubt is always to NOT DRIVE.
